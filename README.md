A Template for starting out with jetpack compose. This template also provides a simple way to display a webview.
This project has evolved so much. so. This is a 2d game template. Built to run on android webview, and run in a browser.


The android bit is Kotlin -> jetpack Compose -> Webview


Then everything on top of that is all Javascript. The Javascript, HTML,  CSS,  you write once and will run on Desktop and Mobile.


There is a communication layer between Android and Javascript for things like:
-Vibration feeback
--other things if needed
-controls




Orientation and aspect ratio are taken into acount!
