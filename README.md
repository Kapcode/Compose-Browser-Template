<p>You can learn just about anything with ai, you just need to know the right questions to ask.</p>
<br><p class="first-line-indented-text">Ai stands for Artificial intelligence. There are many types of Ai but the kinds we are talking about here are Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
<br>
<p class="first-line-indented-text">Cheating, copyright infringement and plagiarism vs a tool for learning. Let's talk about that.<br><br>

LLMS GPT-2 sparked a huge controversial debate around the educational field about this very topic. It was less of a debate and more of a panic really. And for good reason to be honest.<br><br> 

The responsibility lies with the individual using the AI doing research to use it ethically. Meaning if you copy and paste, and don't verify information, and just paste whatever it spits out on your report, or papers you know exactly what you are doing and it is clearly wrong, just as if you went to Google and copied something someone else wrote. BUT it is worse in the case of AI, because your source is an AI language model that grabs information from many sources, and sometimes makes it up, and is just plain wrong.<br><br><br>


So in summary, it only becomes a tool for learning if you use it responsibly.<br><br>

It only becomes a tool for cheating and plagiarism if you use it in those types of ways. (Irresponsibly)<br><br>
