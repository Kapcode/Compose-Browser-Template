        <ul>
            <li>Where is the data coming from?</li>
            <li>Where is my data going?</li>
            <li>What am I comfortable sharing with the AI I'm using?</li>
            <li>Why is that even a concern at all?</li>
            <li>Is my data a concern for me?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Those are all things I would like to talk about here. Let's discuss the data flow, and why even the age-old argument ‚ÄúI have nothing to hide, so why should I care‚Äù does not excuse you from this topic. And to preface this, I'm not about to get all tinfoil hat, conspiracy theory on you, I promise.</p>

        <p>Just as you wouldn't search the Internet for certain things, go to the airport with certain things in your pocket, show up to court to argue your traffic ticket with certain things on your person, there are some data you probably just should keep to yourself.</p>

        <p>I think that covers my point of accidentally incriminating yourself.</p>

        <p>It might also take your mind to the place of identity theft as well. Entering your personal information into any form online that you didn't type the URL to arrive at is üò¨ at best and identify suicide at worst. So entering that type of data into AI prompts is risky business. I'm talking about DOB, mothers maiden name, security question answers, SSN, phone numbers.</p>

        <p>That is like common sense to some, but to others it may not be.</p>

        <h2>Data flow</h2>
        <h3>Data in</h3>
        <p>The one place you will find everything that happens to and with your data is in the privacy policy.</p>

        <p>If you ask the AI about how your data is processed, shared and saved, you will usually be told. The LLM will usually have a conversation with you up to a certain point about data, and the way it is used for training, the way it is secured, then you will usually hit a brick wall at some point about the company user agreement or privacy policy. You will have to look it up and read the fine print yourself.</p>

        <p>That is pretty unrealistic to do for most people. So the moto I go by is if I wouldn't ask it, or share the information with a public librarian, or college professor I just walked up and met, I'm not sharing or asking the AI.</p>

        <p>The end all be all solution is for privacy policies to be practical, and companies to not share your data unless you say it's okay. But the one thing everyone can do is be vigilant, the same way we don't click download now on ads.</p>

        <p>We don't throw out bills with our SSN out in the trash on top just sitting there for someone to read, we are not going to type it in everywhere we see a space online.</p>

        <p>The responsibility falls on the company legally, but in the end, we are the users using this stuff, so maybe we can watch what we put in there? Could I put my SSN in DuckduckGo yea, my identity probably wouldn't get stolen, but is that really necessary? DuckduckGo is a search engine based on privacy. Just because you can, should you?</p>

        <p>There are some LLMs where the data is processed right on the device you are using, it never leaves your device. In those cases, you will be able to give it access to more sensitive data.<br>
            <strong>For example:</strong> I'm typing this up on my new Pixel 9a, my old Moto Edge wouldn't charge anymore. Anyways, the pixel has an AI feature that is computed on the device that listens to microphone data and figures out what song is playing, and shows it in a small notification.</p>

        <p>Now, clearly I'm not leaving my microphone on and piping it to Google cloud AI, if my Moto is what I stated above.</p>

        <p>So you have to make sure you are paying attention to what type of AI you are using, and what it is doing with your data.</p>

        <p>If you are okay with keeping your microphone on for that, you do you, but that's just not my cup of tea. Since it is all on the device, I'm cool with it, my voice stays right in my pocket, it's not somewhere in Texas or something swirling around on a hard drive.</p>

        <h3>Data out</h3>

        <p>That's a lot about your data that you put into the LLM, but what about where the data comes from when you ask for information?</p>

        <h4>Training data.</h4>
        <p><strong>What is training data?</strong><br>
            Data that is built into the LLM that it can query and and go through nearly instantly,</p>

        <p><strong>Where does the data come from that is in the training data?</strong> Some is from the Internet, some is from books, articles, and other sources.</p>

        <p>A big concern though is what bias the data contains. See the section on Bias for a full discussion on Bias. But bias is simply picking sides. Red team vs blue team, maybe it's a 3 sided argument, and the article favors one side more than the others. It could be pulling information from an article written by an angry reporter, that had a bad day, you just don't know.</p>

        <p><strong>How do you avoid that problem?</strong><br>
            Double check the information you are getting from the AI, and use your own thinking skills.</p>

        <h4>Internet.</h4>
        <p>Some LLMs are able to connect to the Internet and search for information live to find more data than what it has built in.</p>
