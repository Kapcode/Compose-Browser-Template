        <h1>Different than search</h1>

        <p>When you use a search engine (Google, Bing, Ask Jeeves üë¥) you are searching or crawling the vast internet for information.</p>

        <p>So you are just putting in a couple of words, and trying to see what comes up.</p>

        <p>With Ai (LLMs) you are asking it a question, or for information. You can think of the AI as a little brain without emotions.</p>

        <h1>Search</h1>
        <p>With a search engine, you are entering in a few words and searching the entire internet for those words, trying to find the top documents and pages with those words on them, and hopefully they are the most relevant to what you want to learn about.</p>

        <h1>LLMs</h1>
        <p>LLMs you want to ask a question, and get an answer. Usually a detailed answer, with a few references to where the information came from. It's like a conversation with someone.<br>
            You are asking a mentor, or better yet a librarian‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt already know the topic but is excellent at looking things up. If it‚Äôs not already part of their training, they look up what they can and explain it to you.<br>
            With LLMs they do the searching behind the curtains if the information is not within its training data, and it goes further than that. They try to explain the answer to the question you have, and help you solve your problem.</p>

        <h1>(Some things to note)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Not all LLMs provide their sources</li>
            <li>Not all LLMs have access to the web</li>
            <li>The user is always responsible for double checking the LLMs output</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Examples: Search VS LLM</h1>

        <h2>Problem 1:</h2>

        <p><strong>Search: (apple android difference)</strong></p>
        <p>If I was using search to solve this problem I would not typically get good results by typing in the entire question into the search box.</p>
        <p>I would use a few key words, and try to find the articles that best match what I'm looking for. Fewer words in your search term doesn't mean better, more doesn't mean better results either.</p>
        <p>Search terms and results end up being just that, a query, and results of ranked pages based on if the terms are in those pages and how popular those pages are.</p>

        <p><strong>LLM:(what's the difference between apple and android?)</strong></p>
        <p>With LLM I would ask the question our right, and be as specific as possible, and where bias is concerned trying to be as neutral as possible. An LLM will handle the short search term just fine usually, but it might not, depending on the context of previous prompts.</p>
        <p>An LLM prompt and answer becomes more like a conversation.</p>

        <p><strong>How can I improve my LMM prompt?</strong></p>
        <p>Add more detailed requests for information.</p>
        <p>Ask for differences, and explanations of why they are different. What do you want to know exactly?</p>

                <h2><strong>(I asked Copilot: to come up with an example of search vs LLM use, and mentioned that I had 2 examples already.)</strong></h2>

                <p>Try it out yourself on your phone!</p>
                <p>Awesome‚Äîframing this around ‚ÄúProblem 3‚Äù makes the contrast even clearer. Here‚Äôs a favorite example I think matches your style: a mix of practical clarity, a touch of humor, and a hint at how LLMs elevate the experience.</p>

                <h3>Problem 3: (üß† Problem 3: ‚ÄúHow much Vitamin D should kids get?‚Äù)</h3>

                <p><strong>Search Engine</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Returns links like Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIH</li>
                    <li>You have to sift through pages for dosage by age group</li>
                    <li>May show conflicting numbers (400 IU vs 600 IU?)</li>
                    <li>You click around, maybe compare 3 articles</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>LLM</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Synthesizes info from NIH, pediatrics sources, and current studies</li>
                    <li>Explains dosage ranges by age, with context for diet & sun exposure</li>
                    <li>Highlights typical ranges (e.g. 600 IU/day for kids 1‚Äì13), notes exceptions</li>
                    <li>You ask follow-up: ‚ÄúWhat if they get lots of sun?‚Äù ‚Äî instant nuance</li>
                    <li>Adds caveat: ‚ÄúAlways confirm with pediatrician‚Äîrecommendations vary‚Äù</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>üßë‚Äçüè´ Why It Works</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Search gets you raw ingredients. LLMs make the soup.</li>
                    <li>LLMs feel like an explainer who knows how to teach‚Äînot just show you links.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you want to build Problems 1 and 2, you could make:<br>
                    Problem 1: I just want a quick answer<br>
                    Problem 2: I want help figuring out how to phrase the question<br>
                    Want help prototyping those? You could even group them under headings like "I need a fact," "I need a framework," and "I need a teacher." Totally fits your vibe</p>

        <p><strong>My thought on the above response (problem 3)</strong><br>
            Copilot definitely did provide an example of the difference between use of search and LLM. But it was not what I focused on, which is really cool. It also points out a huge thing about being specific, and that LLMs tend to go off in one direction or another when providing them with freedom to do so. If you give them open ended space, and you fail to be specific, it's pretty impressive what comes out. Sometimes it is what you expect, sometimes it isn't.</p>
        <p>Search tends to be more specific, but leaves much more work up to you, which is the topic that problem 3, copilot brought up. The irony is not lost on me there ü§£.</p>
