            Avoiding Bias

        <p>Some things to think about.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is Bias?</li>
            <li>Why should I avoid it when it comes to my questions or prompts with ai??</li>
            <li>How can I avoid it?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, what is bias?</p>
        <br><br>

        <p>It is when your opinion leans in any direction. Some can simplify it to an image of a scale trying to balance. Having no bias would be the scale not tipping at all, and in perfect harmony.
            <br>How this actually looks wih words:<br><br>
            <strong>More Neutral Example</strong>
            <br>What brand of toothpaste is best?<br><br>
            <strong>More Bias Example</strong>
            <br>Is Crest The Best Brand of Toothpaste?</p>
        <br><br>


        <p>If you want a more realistic mental image of what bias can really look like if we are talking about a topic that has more than 2 sides, think about it like this.
            <br>You have a plate balanced on a stick in the ground.
            <br>The plate sits right on the center of the stick.
            <br>If you gently drop a handful of rocks on the plate, each representing a side of the argument
            <br>it will become wobbly, from the weights of the rocks being off center, and it will fall over.</p>

        <br><br><br><br>

        <strong>Why should I avoid bias when asking ai questions?</strong>
        <br><br>
        <p>Your answers and results may, and often times skewed by bias in the way you ask the question.
            <br>There are many reasons this may happen. The first reason has to do with us humans, and the internet.
            <br>If you have ever tried looking something up on google when you were sick, you probably have a good idea what I mean.
        <br></p><strong>google search example:</strong>
        <blockquote>"can I die from the flu?"</blockquote>
        <blockquote><strong>VS</strong></blockquote>
        <blockquote>"I have the flu, what are my chances?"</blockquote>
            <br>The outcome of those searches will be very different, one will be informative and calming, the other might incite an anxiety attack.
        <br><br>

        <p>
            When it comes to ai, the information it uses is from both training data, and the internet. Both of which can be biased.
            The best thing you can do to avoid getting unbiased answers is to ask unbiased questions.
            <br>Most of the information you get from asking a neutral question, will be well, neutral. Filled with just the facts, and all the facts of all sides, not just of one side, so you can see the whole picture.
            Imagine asking an Ai:<br><br>
            <br></p><strong>AI "prompt" example:</strong>
        <blockquote>"I hate the sun"</blockquote>
        <p>Very strong bias, returned results only about how negative the sun is, and about my mood.<strong>(Gemini)</strong></p>
        <blockquote><strong>VS</strong></blockquote>
        <blockquote>"Is the Sun bad for you"</blockquote>
        <p>Less bias, returned results weighing the pros and cons of how good the sun is for humans.<strong>(Copilot)</strong>
            <br><br>This is a cool experiment to try yourself, you can test it with search engines too.</p>
